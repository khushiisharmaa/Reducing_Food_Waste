# Reducing Food Waste for Sustainable Development  

## Project Overview 
This project leverages data analytics to address the critical issue of food waste, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):  
- SDG 2: Zero Hunger  
- SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Through data-driven insights, the project aims to identify trends, patterns, and actionable solutions to minimize food waste and promote sustainability.
